I’m Putra Wibisono (Tata). a former Senior Data Engineer turned agri-tech entrepreneur. (Ex-Stripe, Ex-Tesla)

I started my career in data engineering, where I built and optimized large-scale data pipelines for industries ranging from automotive to energy. My focus was on making data clean, reliable, and actionable, so decision makers could move fast and with confidence. Over the years, I became fluent in modern data engineering stacks such as:

* Languages & Frameworks: Python, SQL, PySpark, Flask/FastAPI
* Data Platforms: PostgreSQL, Kafka, Hadoop, Airflow
* Cloud & Deployment: AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes
* Analytics & Visualization: Pandas, PowerBI, Tableau

Today, I’m channeling that technical foundation into something deeply personal and impactful: agriculture. I work at the intersection of data and farming, helping farmers and stakeholders adopt better fertilizer strategies, monitor yields, and optimize soil health. Some of the things I’m currently working on:

* Developing IoT pipelines to track field conditions (pH, moisture, nutrients) via historical data of satelite imaging as initial analysis
* Running demonstration plots trials to validate organic fertilizers and measure productivity gains.
* Building tools to generate transparent reporting for government and industry partners.
* Exploring value-added services like farmer training and digital platforms for agricultural monitoring.

I’m passionate about bridging advanced data systems with real-world agriculture, proving that the same rigor we apply in tech can drive sustainability and food security.
