I provide recommendation letters for individuals I have worked with as colleagues, students, or collaborators. If you've worked with me at Stripe, Tesla, in agricultural technology projects, or as a student in my classes, I'm happy to support your next career step.

## Requesting a Recommendation Letter

I'm happy to provide recommendation letters for individuals I have worked with directly, whether as colleagues, students in my classes, or collaborators on projects. A strong recommendation letter requires that I know your work well and can speak credibly to your skills and accomplishments.

### Who I Can Write For

I can provide meaningful recommendations for:
- **Former colleagues** at Stripe, Tesla, or agricultural technology ventures
- **Students** who have taken my classes or participated in my teaching programs
- **Collaborators** on data engineering, agricultural technology, or research projects
- **Team members** from my agricultural demonstration plots and field trials

### My Areas of Expertise

I can speak most credibly to work involving:
- Data engineering and pipeline development (Python, SQL, PySpark, Kafka, Airflow)
- Cloud platforms and infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes)
- Agricultural technology and IoT systems
- Data analytics and visualization
- Technical leadership and mentorship

### What I Need From You

To write a strong letter, please provide:

1. **Your current resume/CV**
2. **The opportunity details** (position description, program requirements, submission deadline)
3. **Our connection**: How we worked together and the timeframe
4. **Specific projects or accomplishments** you'd like me to highlight
5. **Draft talking points** (optional but helpful) - key strengths or experiences you want emphasized

### Timeline

Please request letters **at least 3-4 weeks** before the deadline. This ensures I have adequate time to write a thoughtful, detailed recommendation.

### How to Request

Send your request to: **president@agrosindustry.com**

Include "Recommendation Letter Request" in the subject line and provide all the information listed above.
